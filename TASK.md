## Issues Discovered During Work
- Vector similarity search returning empty results despite documents being stored
- RPC calls to Supabase `match_documents` function may need debugging
- Need to verify embedding dimensions match between storage and search

## Notes
- Application runs successfully on localhost:8502
- 62 documents successfully uploaded and stored in Supabase
- All embeddings are 1536-dimensional vectors as expected
- Search functionality needs investigation - may be threshold or RPC issue
